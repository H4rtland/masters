### Week 1
###### October 23rd-29th 2017

#### Access HEP cluster

    ssh -Y thartland@lapa.lancs.ac.uk

Already have some example data sets and example analysis scripts to test if ROOT is working.
Works well on the cluster, not on my laptop.
Laptop has errors linking the include files / libraries so I'll use the remote machine from now on.

#### C++ compilation

First example reads in pairs of decay product four vectors and calculates Z boson masses.
The data file is z.dat. It is read by z_read.cpp, which is compiled with the command:

    g++ -o z_read z_read.cpp
    
The Z boson masses are written to z.out.

#### Using ROOT

Example file is z_read_root.cpp.
Needs ROOT libraries / include files to compile.
The correct compiler flags can be generated by `root-config`.

    g++ `root-config --cflags --ldflags --libs` -o z_read_root z_read_root.cpp

This produces a ROOT histogram which can be viewed by starting ROOT with the `root` command,
and starting a new object browser from the ROOT CLI.

    root [0] new TBrowser

After nagivating to the file z_read.root in the file menu on the left, the two generated distributions with different bin sized can be viewed.

#### Modifying for a new data set

Two more example data sets, fourVectorsBig.txt and fourVectorsHuge.txt have B+ meson decays to three particles.
z_read_root.cpp can be modified to read the extra four-vector, and to calculate the invariant mass of the B+
using the new vector. A log plot can be made by right clicking on the canvas
(outside of the plot, for example in the very top left corner) in the TBrowser and selecting SetLogy.
Alternatively, the commands

    gPad->SetLogy()
    gPad->Update()

can be used to the same effect.
