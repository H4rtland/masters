### Continuation

It turns out that the 2017 data is not compatible with the 2016 data at all, so I won't be
using it for actual results. I will however keep some plots with the scaled background
for the expected limits, to show some "here's what the limits will look like with the next data"
plots.

To start finishing up on the plotting I've tried plotting the WStar data, but the bins in the 
monte-carlo simulation histogram do not match the position of the bins in the WStar peak
histograms. I am not sure if I will be trying to fix this or just ignoring them to work on
some other things instead.

For my own sake here is a list of things that still need to be done.

* Make updated brazil plots for q\* / QBH / W' using the latest brazil plot code.
* Not sure if I want to generate new data for those or not.
* Make scaled plots to show expected limits for old+new data.
* Maybe revisit WStar
* Actually write the report.

Since I haven't included them here yet, here are the updated brazil plots with
proper legends / other decoration.

Observed mass limit: 6731 GeV  
Observed cross section limit: 0.0003286 pb  
Expected mass limit: 6549 GeV  
Expected cross section limit: 0.0004807 pb

Observed mass limit: 9161 GeV  
Observed cross section limit: 5.726e-05 pb  
Expected mass limit: 9152 GeV  
Expected cross section limit: 5.892e-05 pb

Observed mass limit: 3843 GeV  
Observed cross section limit: 0.007612 pb  
Expected mass limit: 4030 GeV  
Expected cross section limit: 0.005265 pb  

These will need to be updated after I switch back to using 2016 data only.
