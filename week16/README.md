### New data

We now have a new data set to add to our current one. The new data is 32 fb^-1.

This is the result of performing a per-bin ratio between the new / old data.

Errors are added in quadrature and bins which do not have data in both the new and old
histograms are excluded. At the lowest mass scale the ratio starts out as ~1.15 (37/32)
but drops down below that rather than staying level. This means that there is a noticable effect
due to the triggers having a higher p_T threshold for this data.

Still, we can proceed to add this data to our current data for a total of 69fb^-1 of data.
The smooth background theory that is used to generate random distributions can also
be scaled by 69/37 to get it to match the new amount of data.
